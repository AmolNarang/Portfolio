<h2>Work Experience</h2>
<p>Locobuzz, Mumbai Jul 2023 – Present</p>
<p>Data Scientist</p>

<h3>Newsverse | AI-Powered News Intelligence Platform</h3>
<p>Led AI architecture and pipeline development, driving impactful solutions with strong ownership and leadership.</p>
<ul>
<li>Developed an incremental clustering algorithm powered by semantic embeddings for enriching 500K+ news articles daily in real time, eliminating duplicate content processing and reducing computational overhead by ~50% [USP]</li>
<li>Architected Redis-based dynamic rolling window system with FAISS-powered embedding similarity search, ensuring scalable real-time clustering that handles 10x traffic spikes while maintaining 99.5% uptime</li>
<li>Built agentic AI pipeline with LangGraph orchestrating multi-LLM workflows (GPT-4, Claude), enabling autonomous reasoning over complex news data. This improved client feature adoption by 25% and reduced time to actionable insights from 4 hours (manual workflows) to 30 minutes (automated).</li>
<li>Deployed production LLM pipelines using AWS Bedrock (Claude, Nova) on EKS for real-time content processing including thematic tagging, NER, and abstractive summarization, supporting dynamic content categorization workflows with 95% processing reliability</li>
<li>Developed NV Score, a weighted statistical metric (NewsVerse Proprietary Formula) derived through iterative analysis to quantify event impact, enabling 3x faster decision-making through automated priority scoring</li>
</ul>

<h3>ABSA | Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis End to End Product</h3>
<ul>
<li>Implemented advanced NLP preprocessing pipeline; Fine-tuned T5-Large model using LoRA/PEFT techniques for aspect-opinion extraction and sentiment classification achieving 92% accuracy, improving client analysis precision by 35% over previous rule-based methods</li>
<li>Built & Deployed full-stack Docker-based pipeline on AWS with containerized model serving and CI/CD deployment, integrating ABSA capabilities directly into the CX platform for real-time sentiment analysis</li>
<li>Developed dynamic semantic similarity engine using Cohere embeddings with vector database (FAISS) for intelligent aspect clustering, reducing manual categorization effort by 70% through automated grouping</li>
</ul>

<h3>Response Genie | AI-powered Response Generator for CX</h3>
<ul>
<li>Implemented advanced RAG architecture combining dense retrieval (sentence-transformers) with sparse retrieval (BM25) and reranking using cross-encoders, achieving 30% improvement in response relevance and reducing customer escalation tickets by 40%</li>
<li>Designed prompt engineering framework with few-shot learning and chain-of-thought reasoning, enabling support teams to handle 2.5x more queries per hour through automated response generation with human oversight</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other Projects</h3>
<ul>
<li>Multi-label Social Media Classification: Fine-tuned DistilBERT-base-uncased for categorizing social media posts into 8 intent categories, achieving 78% macro F1-score and improving content routing efficiency by 40%</li>
<li>Promotional Post Detection using ensemble of Random Forest 86% accuracy</li>
